        <h3>Hobbies and Interest</h3>
        <p>
            My passion for reading and writing drives my need to continuously learn new things and share my knowledge with others by working with pupils after school.
            <br/>
            An ambition for creativity has led to doing some freelance work putting my graphic design skills into practice.

            Partaking in multiple school projects which mainly focused on sports, has sparked an avid interest in recreational activities, such as football and tennis.
